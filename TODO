- 'make clean ; make' in all of the following dirs are broken:
   - once fixed run the link checker against them too.

   ece1236-microwaves
   ece1254-multiphysics
   ece1505-convex-optimization
   otherbook

- where is:
   gabookI/gabookI.pdf

   should run url checker and thethe.py against it too if resurrected.

- Landing pages:
   Go through all the pdf links, and if any are to non-versioned versions, update those, and
   add separate landing pages for each of these:

      odds and ends:
         GAbookI
         GAbookII

- Figures:

   Going through this list looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated
   (PlotStyle -> Thick and so forth)

   -- dashes in version_bash.tex weren't showing up properly
      rebuild and refresh all these pdf's

- Rework as 6x9 and post to kdp (for draft copies)

      1254 -- multiphysics << unredacted for myself.
      354  -- classical mechanics
      356 -- qm I
      1229 -- antenna

- 6x9 instructions:

   - specialize: 
      backmatter.tex
      GNUmakefile # new path for $(THISBOOK).tex, ...
      thisbook.sty -- need at least mychapter definition.
      classicthesis-config.tex
      hack preface.tex for the page numbering position bug (add: \thispagestyle{empty})
      customize the dedication and change the rules to avoid the generic one being used (do this for phy485)

      git commit -a
      make clean;make

- Proofing checklist:

   - Equation grammar.
   - Spell check.
   - Periods for chapters, examples, figures, section, subsection, paragraphs.
   - Run urlcheckerpy
   - Run thethe.py
   - Don't use dmath+aligned:  grep -nB1 {aligned} `cat thefiles` | grep {dmath}
   - Fix gutter overflow issues.
   - Look for dmaths in makeproblem, makeexamples, and itemize that lead to inset equation numbers.
   - Check for equations that overlap equation numbers.
   - Check the size of the figures.
   - Check indexes for entries with different spelling/case.
   - Make sure all the indexing is done.  at least chapter,section,paragraph,problems
   - make dist, tag
   - push
   - copy to kdp, leanpub, landing page.
   - bump version.
