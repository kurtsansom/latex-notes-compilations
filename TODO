- Once first version approved: ece1228:

   - kdp: publish redacted copy (wait until my print version arrives: Thurs.)
   - Update the landing page.
   - Post to leanpub too.

- tried running:

      perl -p -i -e 's/^ *$/%/;' `cat toreviewblanks.txt`

  in ece1254-multiphysics, but it resulted in float lost.

   -- review all the old notes collections (and gabook's) for such blanks.  Perhaps attempt some global replacements?

- blog the republish of:

   stat mech
   optics
   condensed matter
   continuum

- have in progress changes (minor)

  phy452-basicstatmech/ (republish later.)

- ready for republish (minor)

   phy1520-quantum/
   phy2403-quantum-field-theory/
   ece1229-antenna/
   phy456-qmII/
   phy450-relativisticEandM/

- ready for republish (minor -- not on kdp nor leanpub)

   ece1505-convex-optimization/
   ece1236-microwaves/
   phy356-qmI/
   gabookII/
   miscphysics/
   classicalmechanics/
   otherbook/ -- this is low quality and now has lots of 6x9 gutter issues.  Don't post without fixing those up (and perhaps never.)

- have in progress reviews on kdp for:

   Continuum Mechanics: Notes and prob...

   Condensed Matter Physics: Notes and...
   Advanced Classical Optics: Notes an...
   Basic Statistical Mechanics: Notes ...
   Electromagnetic Theory: Notes and p...

can I abort the reviews for the last 4?
   https://www.kdpcommunity.com/s/question/0D52T000058ubwfSAA/is-there-a-way-to-abort-inreview-to-unselect-expanded-distribution

Did I select ED for Electromagnetic Theory?

- Add spellcheck rules (sp.mk) to:

   gabookI/GNUmakefile
   gabookII/GNUmakefile

- (after above) Save, make tag, make dist, and repost to filezilla and add changelog

- where is:
   gabookI/gabookI.pdf

   should run url checker and thethe.py against it too if resurrected.

- Landing pages:
   Go through all the pdf links, and if any are to non-versioned versions, update those, and
   add separate landing pages for each of these:

      odds and ends:
         GAbookI
         GAbookII
         ece1236-microwaves/ece1236.pdf
         ece1505-convex-optimization/ece1505.pdf

   # update:

   http://peeterjoot.com/physicsplay-git/

   # and then rewrite:
   http://peeterjoot.com/writing/

- Figures:

   Going through this list looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated
   (PlotStyle -> Thick and so forth)

      phy487-qmsolids
      phy485-optics
         -- repost those when that's done.

      phy454-continuumechanics
      ece1254-multiphysics
      gabook
      ece1505-convex-optimization
      ece1228-electromagnetic-theory
      ece1229-antenna

- Rework as 6x9 and post to kdp (for draft copies)

      1254 -- multiphysics << unredacted for myself.
      354  -- classical mechanics
      356 -- qm I
      1229 -- antenna

- 6x9 instructions:

   - specialize:
      backmatter.tex
      GNUmakefile # new path for $(THISBOOK).tex, ...
      thisbook.sty -- need at least mychapter definition.
      classicthesis-config.tex
      hack preface.tex for the page numbering position bug (add: \thispagestyle{empty})
      customize the dedication and change the rules to avoid the generic one being used (do this for phy485)
      chapter -> mychapter

      git commit -a
      make clean;make

- Proofing checklist:

   - Equation grammar.
   - Spell check.
   - Periods for chapters, examples, figures, section, subsection, paragraphs.
   - Run urlcheckerpy
   - Run thethe.py
   - Don't use dmath+aligned:  grep -nB1 {aligned} `cat thefiles` | grep {dmath}
   - Fix gutter overflow issues.
   - Look for dmaths in makeproblem, makeexamples, and itemize that lead to inset equation numbers.
   - Check for equations that overlap equation numbers.
   - Check the size of the figures.
   - Check indexes for entries with different spelling/case.
   - Make sure all the indexing is done.  at least chapter,section,paragraph,problems
   - make dist, tag
   - push
   - copy to kdp, leanpub, landing page.
   - bump version.
