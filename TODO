Landing pages:
   Go through all the pdf links, and if any are to non-versioned versions, update those, and
   add separate landing pages for each of these:

      odds and ends:
         GAbookI
         GAbookII
         ece1236-microwaves/ece1236.pdf
         ece1505-convex-optimization/ece1505.pdf
         miscphysics/miscphysics.pdf

   # update:

Figures:

   Going through this list looking at the Mathematia based figures to see which should be updated
   (PlotStyle -> Thick and so forth)

      phy487-qmsolids
      phy485-optics
         -- repost those when that's done.

      phy454-continuumechanics
      ece1254-multiphysics
      gabook
      ece1505-convex-optimization
      ece1228-electromagnetic-theory

450, 452, 487, GAelectrodynamics, 2403
   -- dashes in version_bash.tex weren't showing up properly
      rebuild and refresh all these pdf's

Rework as 6x9 and post to kdp (for draft copies)
#  450  -- e&m
#  485  -- optics
#  452  -- stat mech
#  487  -- condensed matter
#  2403 -- fields
#  1520 -- grad qm      -- Arun has given permission not to redact.
#   454  -- fluid mechanics
#   456 -- qm II
   1254 -- multiphysics << unredacted for myself.
   354  -- classical mechanics
   356 -- qm I
   1229 -- antenna

6x9 instructions:

- specialize: 
   backmatter.tex
   GNUmakefile # new path for $(THISBOOK).tex, ...
   thisbook.sty
   classicthesis-config.tex
   hack preface.tex for the page numbering position bug (add: \thispagestyle{empty})
   customize the dedication and change the rules to avoid the generic one being used (do this for phy485)
